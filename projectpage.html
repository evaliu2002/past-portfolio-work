        <h1>CSE 332 (Data Structures and Parallelism Project 1</h1>
        <h2>Partner Project</h2>
        <p>Used java to work with a WorkList ADT which is a generalization of StackS, QueueS, etc. 
            The ADT contains items to be processed in certain orders and is defined as follows: <br>
            add(work) - Notifies the worklist that it must handle work. <br>
            peek() - Returns the next work to work on. <br>
            next() - Removes and returns the next work to work on. <br>
            hasWork() - Returns true if there's any work left and false otherwise. <br>
            We were assigned to write several implementations of the ADT: ArrayStack, ListFIFOQueue,
            and CircularArrayFIFOQueue.
