            <h3>Implementations of a WorkList Abstract Data Type for Different Data Structures Consisting of Collecting Elements</h3>
            <p>Used java to work with a WorkList ADT which is a generalization of Stack, Queue, etc. 
                The ADT contains items to be processed in certain orders and is defined as follows: <br>
                add(work) - Notifies the worklist that it must handle work. <br>
                peek() - Returns the next work to work on. <br>
                next() - Removes and returns the next work to work on. <br>
                hasWork() - Returns true if there's any work left and false otherwise. <br>
                We were assigned to write several implementations of the WorkList ADT: ArrayStack, ListFIFOQueue,
                and CircularArrayFIFOQueue. <br>
                Additional listed implementations of the WorkList ADT are through
                HashTrieMaps and HashTrieSets.

            <h2>Solo Project</h2>
            <h3>Simulating a purchase in Canada paid in US dollars</h3>
            <p>Displays a text shop in the terminal window. Displays price lists for items on sale in Canadian
                dollars. <br>
                Asks the user how many of each item they want. Control the user input (an integer between 0 and 100). <br>
                If a number of items is not between 0 and 100, set it to 0. <br>
                Ask the user to input the amount in US currency to pay for the purchase. 
                Check that the user gave enough money. <br>
                If not, say so to the user and end the program (using System.exit(0)). <br>
                Display a receipt and the change amount in Canadian dollars and cents. <br>
                Break up the change amount in 20, 10, 5 and 1 CA dollar bills <br>
                and CA 25c, 10c, 5c, and 1c coins (e.g. a change amount of $26.56 CA should be <br>
                listed as one $20, one $5, one $1 bills and two 25c, one 5c and one 1c coins). <br>
                The program should use proper spelling (1 10$ bill and not 1 10$ bills). <br>
